# yoagent — Project Overview

## 1. Purpose Statement

`yoagent` is a Rust async library for building stateful, multi-turn LLM agents that can autonomously execute tools to accomplish tasks. The library solves the core engineering problems of agent construction: routing between many LLM provider APIs through a unified interface, running a prompt-then-tool-call loop until the model signals completion, streaming real-time events to UI consumers, and automatically managing context windows so conversations do not exceed model token limits. It is designed to be embedded as a dependency in application code — it provides no standalone binary, no HTTP server, and no user interface of its own.

## 2. Key Capabilities

| Capability | Source Location |
|---|---|
| Multi-turn conversation loop (prompt → LLM → tool call → repeat) | `src/agent_loop.rs` |
| Support for 20+ LLM providers via 7 distinct API protocols | `src/provider/` |
| Real-time event streaming over an async channel | `src/types.rs` (`AgentEvent`), `src/agent_loop.rs` |
| Parallel, sequential, or batched tool execution | `src/agent_loop.rs:execute_tool_calls()` |
| Automatic 3-tier context compaction when token budget is exceeded | `src/context.rs:compact_messages()` |
| Built-in coding tools: bash execution, file read/write/edit, directory listing, grep search | `src/tools/` |
| Sub-agent delegation: run an isolated child agent as a tool | `src/sub_agent.rs` |
| Model Context Protocol (MCP) client for stdio and HTTP tool servers | `src/mcp/` |
| AgentSkills system: load instruction sets from directory-based skill files | `src/skills.rs` |
| OpenAPI tool auto-generation from spec files or URLs (optional feature) | `src/openapi/` |
| JSON serialization of entire conversation history for persistence | `src/types.rs` (all types derive `Serialize`/`Deserialize`) |

| Input filtering: moderation, PII redaction, injection detection | `src/types.rs` (`InputFilter`) |
| User steering mid-run: inject messages between tool calls | `src/agent.rs` (steering queue), `src/agent_loop.rs` |
| Follow-up work queuing: append more tasks after agent would stop | `src/agent.rs` (follow-up queue), `src/agent_loop.rs` |

## 4. Actors & Use Cases

### Application Developer
The primary consumer. Embeds `yoagent` as a library dependency.

| Use Case | How Triggered |
|---|---|
| Build a coding assistant | Create `Agent`, attach built-in tools, call `agent.prompt("...")` |
| Build a CLI REPL | Loop reading stdin, call `agent.prompt()`, render events (see `examples/cli.rs`) |
| Persist conversation across sessions | Call `agent.save_messages()` → JSON → `agent.restore_messages()` |
| Run a task autonomously with limits | Set `ExecutionLimits`, observe `AgentEvent::AgentEnd` |
| Interrupt a running agent | Call `agent.steer(message)` while event loop is running |
| Chain specialized agents | Attach `SubAgentTool` instances to a parent agent |
| Use third-party tools | Connect to an MCP server via `agent.with_mcp_server_stdio()` |
| Expose a REST API as tools | Load OpenAPI spec via `agent.with_openapi_file()` |

### End User (via application)
Interacts through the application wrapping this library. Uses cases match what the application exposes (e.g., CLI prompts in `examples/cli.rs`: `/quit`, `/clear`, `/model`).

### LLM Provider
External service receiving structured HTTP requests. The library sends conversation history and tool schemas; the provider returns streaming token deltas and final messages. Providers never call back into the library.

### MCP Server
External process exposing tools over the Model Context Protocol. The library connects as a client via stdio pipe or HTTP. The server exposes tool definitions that are adapted into `AgentTool` instances.

### Sub-Agent
A child instance of the agent loop spawned internally when a `SubAgentTool` is called. Operates with its own fresh context and toolset. Results are returned to the parent as a `ToolResult`.

## 5. Constraints & Non-Goals

- **No built-in HTTP server.** The library is embeddable only; serving the agent over HTTP requires external frameworks.
- **No user interface.** UI rendering (text display, color, input handling) is the application's responsibility (see `examples/cli.rs` for a reference implementation).
- **No authentication management.** API keys must be supplied by the caller. The library does not fetch, rotate, or cache credentials.
- **Single event consumer per run.** `agent_loop()` returns a single `UnboundedReceiver<AgentEvent>`. Fan-out to multiple consumers requires application-level bridging.
- **No agent-to-agent networking.** Sub-agents run in-process only. No remote agent delegation.
- **No persistent storage.** Conversation state is held in memory. Serialization to disk is the caller's responsibility (the library provides `serialize`/`deserialize` helpers).
- **No token counting via external libraries.** Token estimation uses the fast heuristic of 4 characters per token (`src/context.rs:estimate_tokens()`). Precision counting (via tiktoken etc.) is a non-goal.
- **No multi-modal generation.** Images can be sent *to* the model (as `Content::Image`), but image *generation* is not supported.
- **No structured output / JSON mode.** The library passes raw messages; enforcing structured output is the caller's responsibility via system prompt.
- **Skipped tools on steering.** When steering messages arrive mid-batch, remaining tool calls in that batch are skipped with an error result — their outputs are never computed. This is a documented behavior, not a bug.

## 6. Key Terminology Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Agent** | The stateful object (`src/agent.rs:Agent`) that owns the conversation history, tools, provider reference, and configuration. The application-facing entry point. |
| **Agent Loop** | The recursive execution cycle (`src/agent_loop.rs`) that calls the LLM, processes tool calls, checks steering, and repeats until the LLM stops or limits are hit. |
| **Turn** | One complete LLM call plus the resulting tool executions. Bounded by `TurnStart`/`TurnEnd` events. |
| **Steering** | A `Vec<AgentMessage>` injected into the running loop between tool executions. Used to redirect the agent mid-task without restarting it. |
| **Follow-up** | A `Vec<AgentMessage>` queued to be injected after the agent would naturally stop. Extends the run without creating a new `agent_loop()` call. |
| **StreamProvider** | The trait (`src/provider/traits.rs`) that any LLM backend must implement. Has a single method `stream()` that takes a `StreamConfig` and sends `StreamEvent`s. |
| **AgentTool** | The trait (`src/types.rs`) that any executable tool must implement. Methods: `name()`, `label()`, `description()`, `parameters_schema()`, `execute()`. |
| **ToolContext** | A struct passed to `AgentTool::execute()` containing the call ID, name, cancellation token, and optional progress callbacks. |
| **AgentEvent** | The streaming event enum emitted to the consumer during a run. Covers agent lifecycle, turn lifecycle, message streaming, and tool execution. |
| **StreamDelta** | A partial content update emitted during LLM streaming: `Text`, `Thinking`, or `ToolCallDelta`. |
| **StopReason** | Why the LLM ended its response: `Stop` (natural end), `Length` (token limit), `ToolUse` (returned tool calls), `Error` (failure), `Aborted` (cancellation). |
| **AgentMessage** | The top-level message enum stored in the conversation history. Either `Llm(Message)` (sent to the LLM) or `Extension(ExtensionMessage)` (app-only metadata). |
| **Message** | The LLM-protocol message enum: `User`, `Assistant`, or `ToolResult`. |
| **Content** | A single content block within a message: `Text`, `Image` (base64), `Thinking`, or `ToolCall`. |
| **Usage** | Token count metadata returned with each `Assistant` message: `input`, `output`, `cache_read`, `cache_write`, `total_tokens`. |
| **ContextConfig** | Configuration for the automatic context compaction: token budget, lines-to-keep per tool output, number of recent/first messages to preserve. |
| **CompactionStrategy** | A trait for customizing how messages are compacted when the token budget is exceeded. The default implementation uses 3 tiers. |
| **ExecutionLimits** | Hard caps on agent execution: `max_turns`, `max_total_tokens`, `max_duration`. When exceeded, the loop appends a system message and stops. |
| **ToolExecutionStrategy** | How multiple tool calls from one LLM response are dispatched: `Sequential`, `Parallel` (default), or `Batched { size }`. |
| **CacheConfig** / **CacheStrategy** | Controls prompt caching breakpoint placement for providers that support it (Anthropic). Strategies: `Auto`, `Disabled`, `Manual`. |
| **ThinkingLevel** | Controls extended reasoning depth: `Off`, `Minimal`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`. Translated to provider-specific parameters. |
| **AgentSkills** | A directory-based system for loading instruction files (`SKILL.md`) that extend agent capabilities. Compatible with the AgentSkills open standard. |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol. A standard for tool servers that communicate over stdio or HTTP. The library acts as an MCP client. |
| **SubAgentTool** | An `AgentTool` implementation that, when called by the parent LLM, spawns a complete child `agent_loop()` with isolated context. |
| **InputFilter** | A synchronous trait applied to user text before the LLM call. Returns `Pass`, `Warn(text)` (appended to message), or `Reject(reason)` (aborts run). |
| **ExtensionMessage** | An `AgentMessage` variant that is not sent to the LLM. Used for application-specific metadata (UI state, notifications) stored in conversation history. |
| **ContextTracker** | Tracks context token usage using a hybrid of real provider-reported counts and local heuristic estimates for messages since the last report. |
| **ProviderError** | The error enum returned by `StreamProvider::stream()`. Variants: `Api`, `Network`, `Auth`, `RateLimited`, `ContextOverflow`, `Cancelled`, `Other`. |
| **ToolDefinition** | A schema-only description of a tool sent to the LLM (name, description, JSON Schema parameters). Does not include the `execute` function. |
| **RetryConfig** | Exponential-backoff configuration for retrying `RateLimited` and `Network` provider errors. |
| **AgentLoopConfig** | A flat configuration struct passed to `agent_loop()` / `agent_loop_continue()` bundling all behavioral settings. |
| **QueueMode** | Controls how queued messages (steering/follow-ups) are consumed per read. `OneAtATime` (default): pops only the first queued message. `All`: drains the entire queue at once. |
| **McpContent** | A content item returned by an MCP tool call. Variants: `Text { text }` and `Image { data: base64, mimeType }`. |
| **OpenApiAuth** | Authentication method for OpenAPI requests. Variants: `None`, `Bearer(token)`, `ApiKey { header, value }`. Token/value is redacted in debug output. |
| **OperationFilter** | Controls which OpenAPI operations become tools. Variants: `All`, `ByOperationId`, `ByTag`, `ByPathPrefix`. Operations without an `operationId` are always skipped. |
